# III. Poaching costs

```{r calculating cost of poaching}

# W parameter, proportional increase in cost per unit (trip)

#Step one, get all annual operating costs
# Goal is to calculate cost per vessel trip (we have total fleet days per year which is number of vessels * fishing days per month)
# First calculate total annual costs for the entire fleet

w_par_ops <- w_par %>% 
  mutate(cost_crew_earnings = (totoaba_year * price_fishers_per_totoaba * monthly_earnings_paid)) %>% 
  mutate(cost_food_fuel = (foodfuel_day * total_fleet_days_year)) %>%

So if we assume that each net costs $1,600, then our total cost to the fleet is $664,000.
  add_column(vessel_confs_cost_fleetday=1230000/1920) %>% #Total cost as a proportion of reported vessel seizures averaged over the year (1,920 fishing trips total). There are 150 boats in total each year, and 0.546 are confiscated (there are 82 confiscations a year). So we assume each boat is worth $15,000, and therefore the total cost to the fleet is $1,230,000.

Find the parameter $W_{quad}$ such that :
$$
TotCost(E)=WE^2 \Rightarrow MargCost(E) = 2W_{quad}E
$$

And 

$$
MargCost(E_{hist}) = AvgCost(E_{hist})\Rightarrow W_{quad} = \frac{W_{avg}}{2E_{hist}}
$$

```{r, Quadratic costs}

# IV. Trading costs

```{r trading costs}
c = 0
```
We use `c=` `r c` as trading costs.

# V. Farming costs

```{r calculating cost of farming}

# Farming cost data, from Buche Bros

# Final estimate per tonne of totoaba per year:
v_ = v_par %>% 
  select(op_cost_per_t)%>%
  pull()
age = 4.5
v = v_*age
# Calculating size at harvest
aqua_par_w <- read.csv(here("data","aqua_par_wild.csv"))
aqua_par_f <- read.csv(here("data","aqua_par_farm.csv"))
```
At 4.5 years under farming conditions, a totoaba should have a `r aqua_par_f %>% subset(Totoaba_Age==4.5) %>% select(Weight_Buche_g) %>% pull() %>% round(2)`g swim bladder. At 5 years under farming conditions, a totoaba should have a `r aqua_par_f %>% subset(Totoaba_Age==5) %>% select(Weight_Buche_g) %>% pull() %>% round(2)` g swim bladder
