# Demand estimation
## Preliminary analysis : descriptive states

```{r load data, echo = F}
dat_p = read.csv(here("data","andrew","dat_p.csv")) #Price-quantity data (OG Paper)
dat_b = read.csv(here('data', 'andrew', "dat_bc.csv"))
```

First, look at the evolution of average weight per year : 
```{r avg weight, echo = F}
dat_p %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
 summarise_at(vars(kg), list(name = mean))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,  y = name))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  ylab('Avg weight')
```

Observe a decrease of average weight. Second, look at the evolution of price per buche through time.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
dat_p = dat_p %>%
  mutate(price_buche = g*p,
         price_kg = p*1000)
dat_p %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year))+
  geom_point(aes(y = price_buche))+
  theme_bw()
```

1. Variance of prices decreases with time
2. Average decreases

Conclusion : it seems like the market has evolved. It is hard to say whether (i) there was a crackdown a decrease in demand or (ii) supply increased. 

## Data reformating
First, recover individual totoaba poached from dried buche data. To do so: 

1. q is dried totoaba buche in tonnes : q*1000 is tonnes of dried totoaba buche
2. Given that we assume uniform distribution of totoaba size and that 1 totoaba = 500g of dried totoaba dried totoaba in kilos / 0.5 kilos -> Number of totoaba
3. Compare that to catch data, under the assumption of uniform distribution of size of caught totoaba, all weigh  25.7 kg.
```{r, echo =F}
dat_p = dat_p %>% mutate(totoaba = (q*1000)/.5)
dat_b = dat_b %>% mutate(totoaba = (c*1000/25.7))

data.frame( totoaba_est = dat_p %>% select(totoaba) %>% unique() %>% pull(),
            totoaba_obs = dat_b %>% subset(y>2013) %>% select(totoaba)%>%pull(),
            year = c(2014, 2015, 2016, 2017))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year))+
  geom_line(aes(y = totoaba_est, colour= 'Recovered from dat_p'), linewidth = 1.1)+
  geom_line(aes(y = totoaba_obs, colour = 'Observed catch'), linewidth = 1.1)
  
```

There is a big difference between estimates! Maybe it makes more sense to use price data per buche and observed catch. 

### Attempt 1 : use price per totoaba and variation in realized catch
```{r}
dat_b %>% subset(y>2013)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=y, y= totoaba))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

In what follows : 

* I use the variations in price per totoaba calculated as `price_per_totoaba = p*g` from `dat_p`. 

* I use the variations in realized catch from `dat_bc`, converted to totoaba individuals assuming uniform weight distribution (`tototaba = c*1000/25.7`)

```{r}
results = data.frame()
new_dat = merge(dat_b %>% subset(y>2013) %>% select(y,totoaba) %>%rename(year=y), dat_p %>% select(year, price_buche))
model = lm(price_buche ~ totoaba, data = new_dat)
summary(model)

demand = function(totoaba){
  y = model$coefficients[1] + model$coefficients[2]*totoaba
  return(y)
}

data.frame(x = seq(1,max(dat_b %>% subset(y>2013)%>%select(totoaba)))) %>%
  mutate(demand = demand(x))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = demand))+
  geom_line()+
  xlab('Number of totoabas caught (unitless)')+
  ylab('Price (2019 $USD)')+
  theme_bw()

results = results %>% rbind(model$coefficients)
```

### Attempt 2 : Use price per totoaba and variation in estimated catch (converting dried buche tons to live totoaba)

Just to make sure we have results that are not too weird, I regress price on estimated catch. 


```{r}
new_dat = dat_p %>% select(price_buche, totoaba)
model = lm(price_buche ~ totoaba, data = new_dat)
summary(model)

demand = function(totoaba){
  y = model$coefficients[1] + model$coefficients[2]*totoaba
  return(y)
}

data.frame(x = seq(1,max(dat_b %>% subset(y>2013)%>%select(totoaba)))) %>%
  mutate(demand = demand(x))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = demand))+
  geom_line()+
  xlab('Number of totoabas caught (unitless)')+
  ylab('Price (2019 $USD)')+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0)

results = results %>% rbind(model$coefficients)
```

In the end, we get two demand models : 
```{r}
colnames(results) = c('Intercept (alpha)', 'beta')
print(results)
```

I think the one with estimated quantities of live totoabas in metric tonnes is more reliable.
